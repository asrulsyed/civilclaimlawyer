          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Social media algorithms often prioritize engagement over accuracy, promoting polarizing or sensational content. This can inadvertently amplify hate speech and misinformation, undermining civil rights efforts. These biases disproportionately affect marginalized communities, making it harder for their voices to be heard while giving more visibility to harmful narratives.

This inconsistency can leave vulnerable communities without the digital tools they need to fight injustice.
