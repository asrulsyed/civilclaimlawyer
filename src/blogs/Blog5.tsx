        It’s staggering to think that in 2024, gender pay disparity still
        exists. Women across the globe, and particularly in the U.S., continue
        to earn less than men for performing the same work. According to
        studies, women earn approximately 82 cents for every dollar earned by
        men, and for women of color, the gap is even wider. This discrepancy is
        not just a number, it impacts lifetime earnings, financial independence,
        and retirement security.
