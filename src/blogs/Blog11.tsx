        The right to vote is one of the most powerful tools Americans have to
        shape the government. But this fundamental right wasn’t always  
        guaranteed to everyone. From property-owning white men in the 18th
        century to today’s diverse electorate, the journey of voting rights in
        America is a story of struggle, perseverance, and progress.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        This guide explores the evolution of voting rights in the United States,
        key milestones, and ongoing challenges, offering insights into how far
        we’ve come and the work that remains.

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Are Voting Rights?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Voting rights are the legal protections that ensure every eligible
          citizen can participate in elections without discrimination or
          interference. In America, these rights are guaranteed by the
          Constitution and various federal and state laws.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Why Voting Rights Matter</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Voting empowers individuals to have a say in policies and leaders that
          impact their lives. It is the cornerstone of democracy, providing a
          voice for the people and holding leaders accountable. Without voting
          rights, representation becomes skewed, and certain groups are
          silenced.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
          The Early Days Experienced A Limited Electorate
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In the early years of the United States, voting was restricted to a
          privileged few.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">Who Could Vote in the 18th Century?</p>
        <ul className="ml-10 flex list-outside list-disc flex-col gap-5">
          <li className="text-justify">
            White, property-owning men over the age of 21.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
            Women, enslaved individuals, Indigenous people, and non-property
            owners were excluded.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-justify">
          This narrow definition of the electorate reflected societal
          inequalities, but it also laid the groundwork for future demands for
          broader inclusion.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
          Key Milestones in the Fight for Voting Rights
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">1. The Fifteenth Amendment (1870)</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          After the Civil War, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited voting
          discrimination based on race, color, or previous condition of
          servitude.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Impact: While it extended voting rights to Black men, many states
          enacted barriers like literacy tests, poll taxes, and violence to
          suppress their participation.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          2. The Nineteenth Amendment (1920)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The women’s suffrage movement culminated in the Nineteenth Amendment,
          granting women the right to vote.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Impact: Millions of women joined the electorate, marking a significant
          step toward gender equality.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">3. The Voting Rights Act of 1965</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          This landmark legislation aimed to dismantle discriminatory practices
          like literacy tests and voter intimidation, especially in Southern
          states.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Impact: It authorized federal oversight of voter registration and
          elections in areas with a history of discrimination, dramatically
          increasing voter turnout among minority groups.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          4. The Twenty-Sixth Amendment of 1971
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, reflecting the belief that
          individuals old enough to fight in wars should also have the right to
          vote.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
          Ongoing Challenges to Voting Rights
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Despite significant progress, voting rights remain under threat.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">1. Voter ID Laws</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Strict voter ID requirements in some states disproportionately affect
          low-income individuals, minorities, and elderly voters who may lack
          proper identification.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">2. Gerrymandering</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Manipulating electoral district boundaries to favor one party
          undermines fair representation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Example: Gerrymandering dilutes the voting power of specific
          communities, making elections less competitive.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">3. Voter Suppression Tactics</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          From reduced polling locations to purging voter rolls, these tactics
          make it harder for certain groups to participate in elections.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          4. The Shelby County v. Holder Decision (2013)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          This Supreme Court ruling weakened the Voting Rights Act by removing
          the requirement for federal oversight in states with histories of
          discrimination.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Impact: Many states enacted restrictive voting laws following the
          decision, leading to renewed voter suppression concerns.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
          Modern-Day Movements for Voting Rights
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Organizations and activists continue to fight for equitable access to
          the ballot box.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          1. Advocacy for Automatic Voter Registration
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Many states are adopting automatic voter registration to simplify the
          process and increase participation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          <b>How It Works: </b>Eligible citizens are automatically registered
          when interacting with government agencies unless they opt out.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          2. Restoring Voting Rights for Formerly Incarcerated Individuals
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In several states, individuals with felony convictions lose their
          voting rights. Advocacy groups are working to restore these rights,
          emphasizing the importance of second chances.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">3. Push for Federal Protections</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Proposed legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act
          seeks to restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act by addressing
          modern suppression tactics.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
          Why Protecting Voting Rights Is Crucial
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Voting rights are about more than access to the polls—they’re about
          ensuring every voice matters.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">1. Representation for All</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          A democracy thrives when all citizens, regardless of race, gender, or
          socioeconomic status, have equal opportunities to participate.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">2. Preventing Disenfranchisement</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Protecting voting rights prevents systemic efforts to silence
          marginalized groups, ensuring elections reflect the true will of the
          people.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">3. Upholding Democratic Values</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Without strong voting rights protections, democracy risks being eroded
          by unequal representation and unchecked power.
        </p>

          Conclusion: The Ongoing Fight for Fair Elections
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
