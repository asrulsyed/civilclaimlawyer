        <span className="c1">
          Fighting for social justice is not without obstacles. Civil rights
          lawyers often navigate complex legal battles while facing significant
          resistance from powerful institutions.

      <p className="c0">
        <span className="c1">
          Many civil rights cases involve underfunded communities or nonprofit
          organizations that cannot afford legal representation. Lawyers often
          work pro bono or rely on grants and donations to fund their work. This
          makes resource allocation a constant challenge.

      </p>
      <p className="c0">
        <span className="c1">
          Social justice cases often spark a political backlash. Lawyers
          fighting voter suppression laws, for instance, face opposition from
          policymakers who benefit from restrictive voting measures.
