      <p className="text-justify">
        <span className="c1">
          The First Amendment protects your right to express your opinions and
          ideas, even controversial ones without government interference. This
          includes spoken words, written communication, and symbolic acts like
          protests. But it has limits. Speech that incites violence spreads
          defamation, or constitutes harassment isn&rsquo;t protected.

        <span className="c1">
          In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court ruled that speech
          advocating illegal action is protected unless it incites
          &ldquo;imminent lawless action.&rdquo; This case set the standard for

          Though it&#39;s not explicitly stated in the Constitution, the right
          to privacy has been upheld in landmark Supreme Court cases, such as
          Roe v. Wade (1973) and Griswold v. Connecticut (19765). This right
          protects personal decisions about family planning, health, and
