        Discrimination in Schools: Protecting Student’s Rights to Equal
        Education
      </h1>
      <p className="text-justify">
        A few decades ago, a worldwide conversation about bullying began.
        Finally, all the kids with low self-esteem and feelings of inferiority,
        and those who generally wore clothing their parents picked out for them,
        could come to gather, identify the elephant in the room, and take a
        stand. Bullying was no longer a coming-of-age right, it was a travesty
        and needed to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        But perhaps, none was such a travesty as the case of Ruby Bridges, the
        first African American girl to attend an all-white school where she
        faced racism every day, where the principal’s office became her daily
        refuge, where she was taunted by a woman carrying a black doll in a
        wooden coffin. There may be no greater form of bullying than
        discriminatory bullying, and it happens in schools more frequently than
        it should.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Separate, but not equal</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          It all started way back with school segregation when whites went to
          one school and blacks went to another. All was fine and good until it
          became clear that separate was definitely not equal. In 1964, the
          Supreme Court (Brown vs. Board of Education) ruled in favor of
          renouncing “separate but equal,” intending to provide African American
          students with a richer and fairer educational experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Unfortunately, not everyone heard the hammer of justice coming down.
          White parents all over the nation freaked out at the thought of their
          lily-white children being classified among “negros,’ the word so
          demeaning as to be considered profane. State politicians sent out
          orders to stop white children from enrolling in public schools, passed
          ordinances that eliminated state funding for schools that integrated,
          and went so far as to provide tuition grants for families to enroll
          their children in segregated private schools.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Civil Rights Act</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In 1964, the Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination based on race,
          color, religion, or national origin. The Equality of Educational
          Opportunity study, a.k.a The Coleman Report, concluded that African
          American children benefit from attending integrated schools and set
          the stage for busing to achieve desegregation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">All Hell Breaks Loose</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          What follows here is not very pretty. Across America, white teachers
          clash with African American parents, teachers go on strike, public
          schools close; African American parents boycott white schools, a
          battle with the Klu Klux Klan breaks out, and liberals ask, “Why can’t
          we just all get along?” Fortunately, there is a light at the end of
          this tunnel, if a dim one. White leaders agree to capitulate and some
          southern states negotiate an integration plan.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          While a battle has been won, the war is not over. A tug of war ensues
          between African Americans and white Southerners, with points for each
          side won as quickly as they are lost. A 1983 report by the National
          Commission on Education, “A Nation at Risk,” calls for sweeping public
          education and teacher training reforms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Affirmative Action </h2>
        <img
          src="/images/blogs/8/2.webp"
          alt="Affirmative Action "
          className="mx-auto my-5"
        />
        <p className="text-justify">
          When President Kennedy called for “affirmative action,” colleges heard
          loudly and clearly. Previously, African American students had been
          banned from attending higher education institutions in the South and
          were typically relegated to Black colleges and Universities (HBCU’s).
          Even the northern states heavily favored white students over black
          students in terms of college admissions. African American students who
          did attend college were subject to extreme discrimination. Affirmative
          action would consider socioeconomic obstacles minorities face, giving
          colored students a leg up in the admissions process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          “But what? How is this fair?” mostly white people asked. “How can we
          base college admissions on race? Isn’t that unconstitutional?”
          Apparently, it was. The Supreme Court struck down affirmative action
          in a vote of 6-3; no longer can race be used as a consideration for
          college admissions.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Now?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Now, know. The United States Education Opportunities Center prohibits
          discrimination in schools. (The law is on your side, even if it seems
          no one else is.) If discrimination is rearing its ugly head in your
          community schools, file a complaint, encourage inclusive policies, and
          support organizations that fight discrimination!
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          By the way, according to a 2023 Pew Research Study, most people
          support diversity in schools but not affirmative action. BestCollege
          Survey data indicates that 59% of students believe that racial and
          ethnic diversity improves the learning experience and 62% believe it
          promotes the social experience. Only 37% approve of using race and
          ethnicity to determine college admission status.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The death of affirmative action does not mean the death of students’
          rights! Schools across the country are dedicated to finding
          alternatives to affirmative action. The day will come when “Children
          will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the
          color of their skin but by the content of their character” (Martin
          Luther King, 1963).
