        Back when America was a sparkle in the eyes of a bunch of guys in
        bloomers and ridiculous hairdos, a disagreement arose. See, these guys
        had just come from England, and the English king (who also wore girlish
        pants and ridiculous hairdos) was mean to them. The king made them pay
        excessively high taxes on trivial items, like tea and stamps, and said
        derogatory things about their mamas (Only kidding on that last part, but
        the king was kind of a bully).
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Anyway, when the colonists came to America, they wanted to make sure no
        one bullied them anymore. So, when they wrote the Constitution, they
        included a Bill of Rights that protected citizens from being bullied,
        and a few of those bills were civil rights, and these civil rights
        guaranteed equal opportunities and protected against discrimination.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Civil Rights 101 </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          While “learning” about Civil Rights in school included rote
          memorization, high-pressure tests, and perhaps an unfunny cartoon
          depicting the Continental Convention, knowing your civil rights is
          important because they ensure equal protection under the law
          regardless of race, religion, and other characteristics and guarantee
          equal treatment. With that in mind, here is a kinder, gentler version
          of Civil Rights 101. (Know them, use them).
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold"> What are Civil Rights?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Civil rights include the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, the
          right to government services, the right to free education, and the
          right to use public facilities. (Please take this time, class, to give
          some thought to these. Were there any that came as a surprise to you?
          Can you think of any examples of these in the real world?) Civil
          rights are also necessary components of democracy, (you know where the
          people have the power?), basically because you can’t give people power
          if you’re going to discriminate against them. It’s sort of
          contradictory. So, the goal of civil rights is to make sure that
          groups who are traditionally discriminated against get equal
          opportunities. Because it is not likely that you are part of a group
          that is not discriminated against, civil rights will rear its head in
          some facet of your daily life. And, YOU DON’T HAVE TO TAKE IT!

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Civil Rights Movements</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          When it is found that the government is not adequately providing equal
          protection to its citizens, civil rights movements often emerge. These
          movements tend to engage in civil disobedience, protest, and boycotts
          to express their

          African American Civil Rights Movement
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          What American (of a certain age) thinks of the words” Civil Rights
          Movement” without thinking of Freedom Riders, Rosa Parks, and
          restaurant walk-outs that had nothing to do with the food? The
          American Civil Rights movement aimed to end discrimination against
          African Americans, which ideally should have happened when slavery was
          abolished and African Americans were granted political rights.
          Although late in coming, and not very pretty, the movement managed to
          garner attention at a national level, as demonstrated by the Civil
          Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Acts of 1965.

          Women’s Civil Rights Movement
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Whether it be “Women’s rights are human rights,” or “Anything you can
          do, I can do bleeding” the rallying cry for the women’s movement was
          heard across the nation. Women, eager to escape stereotypes, low pay,
          glass ceilings, and form-fitting bras, took activist action joining
          with government leaders to lobby for equal pay and employment
          discrimination. Although the Equal Rights Amendment, which might have
          passed if it did not include provisions granting women greater access
          to contraception and abortion, never came to fruition, the growing
          national sense of the core goals of the feminist movement was
          achieved.

          Not likely to gain their rights by standing in their closets (Harvey
          Milk) members of the LGBTQ community emerged in the late 1960’s with
          more than a few pairs of pantyhose and falsies. Armed with wit, pride,
          fierceness, and undoubtedly more than a few Cosmopolitans, almost 400
          patrons of a gay bar called the Stone Wall Inn in Greenwich Village,
          New York, responded to a police raid by inciting a riot that lasted
          over 45 minutes and continued on preceding nights. After proving that
          queer was indeed here, the LGBTQ movement, challenged America to get
          used to it, by claiming legal victories including the legalization of
          same-sex marriages, the right to serve in the military, and the
          legalization of same-sexual activity.

        <p className="text-justify">
          Now that you know your civil rights, go out and fight for them - or
          don’t - it’s really up to you and what you feel is in your comfort
          zone. But do know that you have them and that you can use them if you
          think you’re being targeted for discrimination!
