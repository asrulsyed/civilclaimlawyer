        How to File a Civil Rights Complaint: Your Legal Path to Justice
      </h1>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Let’s get one thing straight. No one wants to be a complainer. People
        don’t like complainers; they’re always pointing out what’s bad about
        something and ruining it for everyone else. Just think about people who
        complain about food in a restaurant. The waiter doesn’t like them
        because he thinks the complaint will negatively effect his tip, the cook
        doesn’t like them because they suggest that his cooking is under par,
        and his fellow diners don’t like him because he is embarrassing them and
        killing the vibe.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        However, good things do come from complaints. For example, the food
        returner may get a free dessert to compensate for his dissatisfaction,
        which he might share with his friends, and the party might give the
        waiter a big tip to split with the chef to show their gratitude. That
        way, he’s happy, the waiter is happy, the chef is happy and the
        complainer’s friends are happy. Hence, complaining might be the thing to
        do.

        Besides, Americans come from a long line of complainers. Just think of
        the grievances the colonists sent King George III when they wanted to
        split from England! Complaining is in our blood! Not complaining would
        be unpatriotic!
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        While we’re on the subject of patriotism, let’s not forget our civil
        rights! Our civil rights protect us from getting pushed around. If your
        civil rights get violated, it would be downright unAmerican not to
        complain. Luckily, there is a website for that and you can find the one
        that serves your state by typing “Civil Rights Division” into your
        search bar.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Can I Complain About?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Not the weather and not your spouse - the Civil Rights Division wants to hear about important stuff, like workplace discrimination, housing discrimination or harassment, discrimination at school or another educational institution, mistreatment by police, interference with the voting process, discrimination in a public place, hate crimes, and human trafficking. 
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Can the Civil Rights Division Do About It? </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        The Civil Rights Division protects your rights through
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-10 flex list-outside list-disc flex-col gap-5">
          <li className="text-justify">
          Enforcement: It sues and prosecutes individuals and organizations that violate civil rights.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          Education: It helps the public understand how to comply with the laws
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          Coordination: It helps the federal government to work together to enforce the laws.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Wow! It sounds like these are the kind of people you want on your side!  But nothing will get done until you file your complaint! 
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Filing A Complaint </h2>
        <ul className="ml-10 flex list-outside list-decimal flex-col gap-5">
          <li className="text-justify">
          While it may vary slightly from state to state, one usually begins filing a complaint by filling out an online form. On this form, you will provide the details of the infraction in a clear and professional tone. It would be best to avoid profanity; although discrimination can easily provoke anger. These are nice people, save the profanity for the haters.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          After sending the report, the Division will give you a confirmation number and send it to the staff for review.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          A team will review your report. If the team does not feel suited to handle your complaint, the complaint will be forwarded to another agency. 
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          After reviewing your complaint, the team will determine the next steps and get back to you. You may be asked for more information, directed to another organization that can help, or the team will take steps toward an investigation or mediation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Possible Outcomes</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Maybe not a dessert on the house, but filing your complaint can get you recovery of out-of-pocket losses, an injunction prohibiting the unlawful practice, access to housing or a job opportunity, policy changes, training, reasonable accommodations, damages for emotional distress, and civil penalties, and punitive damages. That could amount of moolah!

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Else You Get</h2>

        But wait there’s more! According to Psychology Today, complaining in general provides

          <li className="text-justify">
          Social Bonding: You might make a connection with other similarly disenfranchised people!

          Self Awareness: Articulating your complaints makes you more aware of your own needs!

        </ul>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Remember, the Civil Rights also include the “the right to free speech.” Excercise it by filing a complaint if your civil rights are violated! May your constructive complaints be heard and your coffee be strong!
