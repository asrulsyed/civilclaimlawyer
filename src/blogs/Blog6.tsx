        Civil Rights for Gig Workers: Understanding Protection in the Modern
        Economy
      </h1>
      <p className="text-justify">
        One might say gig-working is a one-night- stand of jobs. No commitments,
        no “see you in the morning,” no criticism for wearing sweatpants, and no
        toxic relationships. Even the word “gig” itself is something of a joke.
        It’s only three letters and it’s half of the word “giggle.” How much of
        a responsibility could half of the word giggle be?
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Well, apparently, just as one-night stands can turn into long fruitful
        relationships, gigs can turn into long-time jobs. And when they do, they
        can get messy (which is why so many of us shun commitment in general).
        They get particularly complex when it comes to qualifying for insurance
        and unemployment benefits. If you’re playing the field in the job
        market, here are a few things you should know about protection.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What is a Gig Worker?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          For those who wish to know, but felt stupid asking, a gig worker is an
          independent contractor, which means he is free of outside control. The
          ABC test helps determine if a person is an employee or a contractor
          using the following three criteria.
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-10 flex list-outside list-disc flex-col gap-5">
          <li className="text-justify">
            The person is free of an employee's control in performing the work.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
            The worker’s services are outside the employer’s regular business.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
            The worker has an independently established job.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-justify">
          If a person is determined to be an independent contractor, the
          employer does not make payroll deductions or withhold taxes for social
          security - which all sounds like fun and games until you get hurt on
          the job, need to file for unemployment or disability insurance, desire
          a paid family leave, or seek worker’s compensation.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What is a Gig Worker to Do?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Before you think of renouncing your individualism, getting a
          nine-to-five job, and becoming a pawn of the capitalist society, know
          that you can earn your bread and butter and eat it too! Here are some
          ways the people of America are making way for a new generation of
          indispensable workers.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Portable Benefits</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Belying the traditional wisdom of “you can’t take it with you”
          portable benefits move with the worker, allowing entrepreneurial
          mavericks of all walks of life, to enjoy the same health care
          benefits, retirement savings, paid leave, and financial planning
          reserved for respectable citizens with steady jobs. Beginning in 2018,
          legislators in Alabama, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Georgia,
          Massachusetts, California, Washington, and Vermont have introduced
          legislation establishing portable benefits for gig workers. The
          Portable Benefits Program Act was introduced to the House in 2023. If
          passed, it would provide grants to states, local governments, and
          non-profit organizations to develop portable benefits programs.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Proposition 22</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Rideshare and delivery workers have become the first-hand responders of the modern world. They pick us up when we’re stranded, get us to work on time, and deliver anything we want from the grocery store at odd times of the night. It is only right that we honor such brave and dependable service people with guaranteed minimum earnings, healthcare coverage, accidental death insurance, and protection against discrimination. Luckily, companies like Lyft, Uber, and DoorDash recognized the value of their fine employees by proposing a bill that would give them the protection they rightly deserve. Proposition 22 passed in November 2020, allows companies to classify their workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, enabling them to receive:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-10 flex list-outside list-disc flex-col gap-5">
          <li className="text-justify">
          A guaranteed earnings-floor minimum of 120% of the local minimum wage work.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          A healthcare subsidy for drivers who work more than 15 hours per week
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          Occupational accident insurance and death insurance
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          Protection against discrimination and sexual harrassment
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Wage and Hour Protection</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        In some states, minimum wage laws apply to independent contractors, and so does overtime pay for working more than 8 hrs a day in a 40-hour week. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Anti- Discrimination Laws</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        In states, such as California, gig workers are protected against discrimination based on race, gender, age, or disability. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">On a Federal Level</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        While the federal government has yet to commit itself to reclassifying independent contractors as employees, there has been strong flirtation. The Pandemic Unemployment Program temporarily extended benefits to gig workers during the COVID outbreak. Perhaps the flirtation will rekindle itself and ignite a gig worker revolution!
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Gig workers are no longer the black sheep of the modern economy! Know your rights, claim your rights, and keep on keepin’ on!
