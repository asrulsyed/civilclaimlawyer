      <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-bold">Permits and Public Spaces</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        While protests in public spaces are generally allowed, some
        jurisdictions require permits, especially for large gatherings or
        marches. Understanding local regulations can prevent unnecessary
        conflicts with law enforcement. Permits are often needed for marches on
        roads or demonstrations in parks, so checking your local rules

      <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">The Right to Remain Silent</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        If approached or questioned by the police, you have the right to remain
        silent. You are not obligated to answer questions about your
        participation in the protest or share personal information beyond
        identifying yourself if required by local laws.
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-bold">Searches and Privacy</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Police officers cannot search your belongings or devices without a
        warrant or probable cause. This includes your phone and digital data.
        Activists can take precautions by using secure messaging apps or
        enabling device encryption to protect sensitive information. Protecting
        privacy is essential for maintaining the integrity of civil rights
        movements.

      <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-bold">When Arrested</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        If you are arrested during a protest, you have the right to an attorney.

        In today’s digital age, protests are often monitored through

        Technologies like facial recognition, social media tracking, and mobile
        phone monitoring have made it easier for authorities to observe and
        sometimes target activists. These practices can lead to violations of

        Protecting Your Identity Online
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Social media is a powerful tool for organizing protests, but it also
