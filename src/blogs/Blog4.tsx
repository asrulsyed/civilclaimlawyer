      <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What is the Fair Housing Act?</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The <b>Fair Housing Act (FHA)</b> was passed in 1968 as part of the
        Civil Rights Act to eliminate housing discrimination in the United
        States. It protects individuals from discrimination in housing-related
        activities, such as renting, buying, and financing homes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-bold">Who is Protected by the FHA?</h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The Fair Housing Act (FHA) draws a clear line: discrimination in housing
        is not just unfair, it’s illegal. This groundbreaking law protects
        individuals from being denied housing or treated unfairly based on:

      <p className="text-justify">
        This law doesn’t just apply to landlords, it holds real estate agents,
        lenders, property managers, and anyone involved in housing accountable.
        Imagine this: a landlord refuses to rent to a family simply because they
        have young children. That’s not just unethical; it’s a direct violation
        of the FHA.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        These protections exist to ensure everyone, regardless of their
        background or circumstances, has an equal chance at finding a home. But

        Unequal Benefits of FHA Programs: A Historical Perspective

        area, highlighting FHA benefit disparities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Although the Fair Housing Act (FHA) dramatically expanded homeownership
        opportunities, its benefits were not equally distributed across all
        segments of the population. FHA programs primarily favored the
        construction of new single-family homes, aligning with the image of the
        nuclear family in suburban America. This became synonymous with the
        “American dream” of homeownership.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        However, these programs initially excluded many vulnerable groups.
        Low-income families, single women (unless they were war widows), the
        non-wage-earning elderly, and racial minorities were often left out. For
        decades, discriminatory{" "}

        obtaining loans.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        This exclusion reinforced systemic inequalities, making it harder for
        marginalized communities to access the same opportunities for
        homeownership and stability.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The FHA has since evolved, but its history serves as a stark reminder of
