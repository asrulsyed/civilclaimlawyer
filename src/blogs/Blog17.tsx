          The right to free speech is one of the most fundamental freedoms

          their opinions without fear of government censorship. However, this
          freedom isn&#39;t absolute. While free speech protects our democratic
          rights, unchecked hate speech can cause real harm. The rise of hate
          speech has led to intense debates about where free speech ends and
          hate speech begins.

          Hate speech refers to words, actions, expressions, or symbols designed

          Surprisingly, hate speech is not always illegal. In the U.S., hate

          censored simply because it&rsquo;s offensive. However, when hate
          speech crosses certain legal boundaries it loses its constitutional
          protection. Hate speech is inciting violence and targeted harassment.
          This broad protection underpins a larger commitment to preserving free
          expression but also raises questions about its societal impact.
