      The Role of the Supreme Court in Civil Rights Progress"
      </h1>
      <p className="text-justify">
      If you think Judge Judy is the “judge supreme,” you must not leave your house very often. Sure, when you’re on your couch, Judge Judy can seem pretty powerful, and she does know her way around cat-fights, keyed cars, slumlords, and aggressive dogs, but she doesn’t quite have the authority of the Supreme Court.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What is the Supreme Court?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        The Supreme Court is the highest in the country, and you don’t want to mess with it any more than you would with Judge Judy. These are the guys and gals who put things to rights. When there are arguments about laws, they look at the Constitution and figure out whether or not it’s been violated, and if it has been, G-d pity the poor fool who’s responsible. 
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">What Is the Supreme Court Known For? </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Remember Brown vs. the Board of Education, which declared segregation in public schools was unconstitutional? That was the Supreme Court interpreting the law. And who could forget Roe vs. Wade which protected a woman’s right to have an abortion? Supreme Court again! And who do you think made President Nixon hand over those incriminating tapes? One for the Supreme Court - none for Tricky Dicky! 
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Supreme Court Background</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        “The judicial power of the United States shall be invested in one Supreme Court, and in such that inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” So says Article III of the Constitution. This basically means that Congress can help organize the Supreme Court, but have no power in decision-making.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Court Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        So what separates the cases that go to the Supreme Court from the ones that Judge Judy handles? Apparently, the Supreme Court is too busy settling disputes between states and cases involving ambassadors and foreign ministers than dealing with brawls between in-laws. The Supreme Court also has appellate jurisdiction on almost any case that involves the Constitution or Federal Law. These include cases in which the United States is a party, cases involving treaties, and cases involving ships on the high seas and navigable waterways.

        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">The Justices </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Right now, they’re John G. Roberts (Chief Justice) Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh, Amy Conan Barrett, and Ketanji Brown-Jackson. Some are more vocal than others: Sotomayor has rockstar status for upholding the Affordable Care Act twice and the legalization of same-sex marriage. Conan Barrett raises Democratic eyebrows (and provides a wealth of material for late-night talk show diatribe), as the Trump-nominated conservative, while Brown-Jackson gets props as the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court. You go, girl! 
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
        The president appoints the justices with approval from the Congress. The justices typically hold office for life. The judges’ salaries cannot decrease while they are in office. These protections serve to maintain their independence from other political branches of government. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Supreme Court’s Role</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Much more than a steady job with a decent paycheck, the position of Supreme Court judge comes with some heavy responsibilities!  First, as the highest court in the land, they are the last resort for someone seeking justice. Second, their power of judicial review ensures the other branches of government don’t get too powerful. Third, they strike down laws that violate the Constitution! (Amen!) And lastly, they ensure that minorities don’t get taken advantage of! Ah, the sweet sound of liberty and the harmonic notes of everyone just getting along!
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
        In essence, the Supreme Court protects the civil rights of all Americans! 
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">Parting Words of Wisdom</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
        Perhaps not as wise as that of the judges themselves, nor Judge Judy for that matter is the wisdom offered at the end of this small expositional essay. And that wisdom is that the Supreme Court judges are some tough mothers and brothers and they’re striking the hammer of justice down on civil rights violations! Take that with you when you’re getting down with your bad self!
